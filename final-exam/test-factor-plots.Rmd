## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

xList <- as.factor(sample(c("a", "b", "c"), 100, replace = TRUE))
yList <- as.factor(sample(c("x", "y", "z"), 100, replace = TRUE))
m <- cbind(xList, yList)
plot(x = xList, y = yList )


xList <- as.factor(sample(c("a", "b", "c"), 100, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.90, 0.05, 0.05)))
yList <- as.factor(sample(c("x", "y", "z"), 100, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.90, 0.05, 0.05)))
m <- cbind(xList, yList)
plot(x = xList, y = yList )

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
